(each word is 32 bits) of directly memory, a 32 bit ILU, 8
addressable registers and 4 non-addressable registers. Of the
addressable registers, $0 always holds the number 0 and cannot be
modified, and $7 contains a return address for jump and link
instructions. The non-addressable registers are the LC, which holds
the address of the current instruction, the NIC, which holds the
address of the next instruction, the EFFADDR, which will hold the
address of data when it is to be accessed, and the IWD, which holds
the instruction being exectued.</P>
